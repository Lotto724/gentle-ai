## Activation Contract

Run this phase when the orchestrator/user asks to initialize SDD in a project. You are the phase executor: do the work yourself, do not delegate, and do not behave like the orchestrator.

## Hard Rules

- Detect the real stack, conventions, architecture, testing tools, search strategy, and persistence mode; never guess.
- In `engram` mode, do **not** create `openspec/`.
- In `openspec` mode, follow `../_shared/openspec-convention.md` and write file artifacts.
- In `hybrid` mode, write both openspec files and Engram observations.
- Always persist testing capabilities separately as `sdd/{project}/testing-capabilities` or `openspec/config.yaml` `testing:`.
- Persist resolved `search_strategy` with project context/config; default to `grep` when no explicit semantic/vector/embedding MCP tool qualifies.
- Always build `.atl/skill-registry.md`; also save `skill-registry` to Engram when available.
- Use `capture_prompt: false` for automated SDD/config saves when supported; omit it if the tool schema lacks it.
- If `openspec/` already exists, report what exists and ask before updating it.

## Decision Gates

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| `mode=engram` | Save context and capabilities to Engram only. |
| `mode=openspec` | Create/update openspec bootstrap files only. |
| `mode=hybrid` | Do both Engram and openspec persistence. |
| `mode=none` | Return detected context only; write no SDD artifacts except registry if required. |
| strict TDD marker/config found | Use that value. |
| no marker/config but test runner exists | Default `strict_tdd: true`. |
| no test runner | Set `strict_tdd: false` and explain unavailable. |
| explicit `search_strategy` marker/config found | Use that value. |
| semantic/vector/embedding MCP tool detected | Set `search_strategy.mode: hybrid` and record the MCP tool. |
| no qualifying RAG MCP tool | Set `search_strategy.mode: grep` silently. |

## Execution Steps

1. Inspect project files (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, CI, lint/test config) and summarize stack/conventions.
2. Detect test runner, test layers, coverage, linter, type checker, and formatter.
3. Resolve Strict TDD from agent marker, `openspec/config.yaml`, detected runner fallback, or no-runner fallback.
4. Resolve `search_strategy` from agent marker, `openspec/config.yaml`, conservative MCP auto-detection, or `grep` fallback.
5. Initialize persistence for the resolved mode.
6. Build `.atl/skill-registry.md` using the skill-registry scan rules.
7. Persist testing capabilities, search strategy, and project context.
8. Return the structured initialization envelope.

## Output Contract

Return `status`, `executive_summary`, `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`. Include project, stack, persistence mode, Strict TDD status, Search Strategy status, testing capability table, saved observation IDs/paths, registry path, and next `/sdd-explore` or `/sdd-new` step.
