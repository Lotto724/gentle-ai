## Activation Contract

Load this skill only when the user explicitly asks for Judgment Day, dual/adversarial review, or equivalent Spanish trigger (`juzgar`, `que lo juzguen`). Review a specific target: files, feature, PR, or architecture slice.

## Hard Rules

- Resolve project skills before launching agents: read skill registry, match skill paths by target files/task, and inject the same `Skills to load before work` block into both judge prompts and fix prompts.
- Launch **two blind judges in parallel** with identical target and criteria; never review the code yourself.
- Wait for both judges before synthesis; never accept a partial verdict.
- Classify warnings as `WARNING (real)` only if normal intended use can trigger them; otherwise downgrade to INFO as `WARNING (theoretical)`.
- Ask before fixing Round 1 confirmed issues.
- After any fix agent runs, immediately re-launch both judges in parallel before commit/push/done/session summary.
- Terminal states are only `JUDGMENT: APPROVED` or `JUDGMENT: ESCALATED`.
- After 2 fix rounds, stop: report anything still open to the user as open and escalate — the loop never extends.

## Decision Gates

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Target unclear | Ask for scope; do not launch judges. |
| No skill registry | Warn, proceed with generic criteria, and record `Skill Resolution: none`. |
| Both judges find same BLOCKER/CRITICAL | Confirmed; ask/fix according to round rules. |
| Judges find only warnings/suggestions | Report once as INFO; never fix, never re-judge. |
| One judge finds issue | Suspect; report and triage, do not auto-fix. |
| Judges contradict | Escalate for manual decision. |
| Round 2+ has only theoretical warnings/suggestions | Report as INFO; do not re-judge. |

## Execution Steps

1. Confirm target and optional custom criteria.
2. Resolve exact skill paths from registry or warn if missing.
3. Start Judge A and Judge B concurrently via delegation; each runs its sweep-budgeted first pass and emits its own findings ledger.
4. Synthesize findings into confirmed, suspect, contradiction, and INFO buckets; merge both judges' ledger rows into the persisted ledger and persist per the artifact-store branch.
5. Ask before Round 1 fixes; delegate a separate fix agent for confirmed approved fixes only. The fix agent reads the persisted ledger, applies only confirmed fixes, and sets addressed ledger ids to `fixed`.
6. Re-judge in parallel after fixes, scoped to the persisted ledger and the fix diff per the Scoped re-review contract; repeat within the convergence budget (maximum 2 fix rounds), then either approve or escalate with remaining issues reported as open.
7. Before any terminal action, verify every active Judgment Day has a terminal state.

## Output Contract

Return `## Judgment Day — {target}` with round number, verdict table, confirmed/suspect/contradiction counts, fixes applied, ledger persistence location, re-judgment result, `Skill Resolution`, and final `JUDGMENT: APPROVED ✅` or `JUDGMENT: ESCALATED ⚠️`.

## Ledger and Re-Judge Contract

**Sweep budget.** Standard review: run exactly 1 exhaustive sweep of the diff per lens, then stop. Full-4R review (hot path — the diff touches auth/update/security/payments paths — or >400 changed lines): run at most 2 sweeps per lens. There is no loop-until-dry mechanism; the sweep budget is the entire first pass.

**Precision gate.** Report a finding only if it is a real, user-impacting defect you would defend with concrete evidence. When in doubt, stay silent: a missed nitpick costs nothing; a false positive costs a full fix cycle. Style and preference findings are banned unless they obscure a defect.

**Findings ledger.** Emit a findings ledger with this schema for every entry:

| Field | Values |
|-------|--------|
| `id` | `{LENS}-{NNN}` (e.g. `R1-001`) |
| `lens` | risk \| readability \| reliability \| resilience \| judgment-day |
| `location` | `path/to/file.ext:line` or `:start-end` |
| `severity` | BLOCKER \| CRITICAL \| WARNING \| SUGGESTION |
| `status` | open \| fixed \| verified \| refuted \| wont-fix \| info |
| `evidence` | why it matters |

If the first pass finds nothing, persist an empty ledger record rather than skip persistence.

**Adversarial verification.** Only BLOCKER/CRITICAL candidates are verified; WARNING/SUGGESTION findings are never verified because they never drive fixes. Standard review: one refuter agent attempts to refute each BLOCKER/CRITICAL candidate; if refuted, record the finding with status `refuted` — it never enters the fix loop. Full-4R review: a panel of 3 refuters with distinct lenses (correctness, exploitability/impact, reproducibility) attempts the refutation; a finding is killed only if at least 2 of 3 refuters refute it — ties favor keeping the finding.

**Refutation protocol.** The orchestrator invokes refutation after merging lens ledgers and before any fix work; only BLOCKER/CRITICAL candidates are refuted. Standard review: delegate one `review-refuter` agent with the `general` lens. Full-4R review: delegate three `review-refuter` agents in parallel, one per distinct lens (correctness, exploitability/impact, reproducibility). A finding is recorded `refuted` only when the single refuter refutes it (standard) or when at least 2 of 3 refuters refute it (panel). In judgment-day, adversarial verification is satisfied by the two-judge convergence itself: a BLOCKER/CRITICAL confirmed by both blind judges has survived adversarial verification; judgment-day does NOT additionally spawn `review-refuter` agents.

**Severity floor.** Only BLOCKER/CRITICAL findings that survive adversarial verification enter the fix → re-review loop. WARNING/SUGGESTION findings are reported once with status `info`, are never re-reviewed, and never block.

**Convergence budget.** Maximum 2 fix rounds per review. One fix round = the orchestrator (directly or via a single writer sub-agent) applies fixes for all open verified BLOCKER/CRITICAL findings, then a scoped re-review verifies the fix diff against the ledger; in judgment-day the fix actor is `jd-fix-agent`. Anything still open after round 2 is reported to the user as open — the loop never extends.

**Ledger persistence honors the artifact store.**
- `openspec`: write `openspec/changes/{change-name}/review-ledger.md`.
- `engram`: upsert topic `sdd/{change-name}/review-ledger` (ad-hoc judgment-day without a change: `review/{target-slug}/ledger`, where `target-slug` = `pr-{number}` when reviewing a PR, else the current branch name kebab-cased, else a kebab-case slug of the user-stated review target).
- `none`: keep the ledger inline in the response; do not write files or Engram artifacts — the ledger lives only in this conversation; complete the review → fix → re-review loop within the session because it is not persisted across compaction.

**Scoped re-review.** A re-review pass receives ONLY the persisted ledger and the fix diff as input — never the original full diff. It MUST verify each ledger finding's resolution and MUST review only fix-touched lines; it MUST NOT re-read the full original diff. A finding on an untouched line MUST be logged with status `info` as a first-pass quality signal and MUST NOT by itself trigger another full round. The re-judge pass following jd-fix-agent follows this same scoped re-review contract.

**Execution mode.** Judgment-day judges run as delegated agents; when this agent is a named sub-agent (Claude, Kiro), emit your own ledger rows and hand them to the orchestrator, which merges both judges' rows into the persisted ledger. Otherwise, the orchestrator runs both judges via generic delegate and maintains the merged ledger directly.
